## Styling List
Create an HTML file with an ordered list of at least 5 college events. Each event should include the event name, time, and location as nested unordered list.

Style the list using CSS to make it stand out:

1. Use custom bullets or numbers instead of default ones
2. Add hover effects that change the color of the text or background when the user hovers over an event.
3. Include spacing and padding to ensure the list is easy to read.

## Styling Table
Create an HTML table to keep track of your grades throughout the semester. You should list all your modules, assignments, exams, and their respective scores. The table should include the following columns:

- Module
- Assignment/Exam Name
- Maximum Marks
- Marks Obtained
- Percentage
- Grade

**Example:** Module: "SDA101" - Assignment 1: "Figma Design" - Max Marks: 10 - Marks Obtained: 7 - Percentage: 70% - Grade: B
